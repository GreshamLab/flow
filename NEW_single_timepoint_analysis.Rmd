This notebook contains the code necessary to analysis flow cytometry data in the Gresham Lab. To analyze flow cytometry data, you MUST use the latest version of this code, available on the [Gresham Lab github](https://github.com/GreshamLab/flow). 

```{r User Defined Variables}



```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
