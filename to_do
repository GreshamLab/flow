this is a to do list for updating the flow cyto pipeline

1. Make things tidyverse & ggplot compatible
2. Make things modular and robust to different experimental designs
3. Options to output from single timepoint analysis
    a) df with all/some data
    b) summary stats
    c) just write to .fcs file
4. standardize samplesheet


Grace will do:
1. make gating more robust (variables for gate vertices rather than hard coded matrix sizes)
2. make output file name a variable - or make default include datetime
