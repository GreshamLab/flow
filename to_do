this is a to do list for updating the flow cyto pipeline

1. Make things tidyverse & ggplot compatible
2. Make things modular and robust to different experimental designs, write as functions
3. Options to output from single timepoint analysis
    a) df with all/some data
    b) summary stats
    c) just write to .fcs file
4. standardize samplesheet


PLAN
1. Start a new Rmd
2. Figure out what variable options to have
3. Figure libraries we need
4. Add qc (plots etc)
5. Make different output file types

Grace will do at some point:
1. make gating more robust (variables for gate vertices rather than hard coded matrix sizes)
2. make output file name a variable - or make default include datetime
