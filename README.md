Scripts for processing flow cytometry and FACS data

We will make this actually useful this week by learning how to use these scripts

The overall strategy for using flow cytometry analysis is:

1. Perform gating for

    i) doublets, 
    ii) debris and 
    iii) fluorescence using an R script and save gates as .Rdata file.
    
2. Import .Rdata file containing gates and render Rmarkdown file in order to save report of work.
