Scripts for processing flow cytometry and FACS data

The overall strategy for using flow cytometry analysis is:

1. Put your `.fcs` files and a `SampleSheet.txt` in a folder.
2. Modify the script to point at that folder, or folders.
3. Run the script, gating when prompted. Modify the gating to gate
   on different parameters than those implemented.

`./src/` contains snippets of R code for functions and things.

To run the example script, download the dataset
